### Creational Patterns

#### Factory Method
- **Payment Service:** `src/services/payment-service/src/service/PaymentServiceFactory.ts` - Creates payment implementations based on payment method
- **Playlist Service:** `src/services/playlist-service/src/service/generate/factory/PlaylistFactory.ts` - Creates different playlist group types

#### Singleton
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/service/MusicBaseMediator.ts` - Implemented as singleton with `@singleton()` decorator
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/service/MusicStreamMediator.ts` - Implemented as singleton
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/service/MusicUserMediator.ts` - Implemented as singleton

### Structural Patterns

#### Proxy
- **API Gateway Service:** `src/services/api-gateway/src/proxy/CreateProxy.ts` - Routes requests to appropriate microservices
- Handles request forwarding, header modification, and response processing

#### Facade
- **API Gateway Service:** `src/services/api-gateway/src/index.ts` - Acts as a facade for the entire microservice system
- **Service Interfaces:** Each service's interface directory provides simplified facades to complex subsystems

#### Adapter
- **Music Service:** Found in grpc and dto directories - Adapts data between different formats and services
- **User Service:** Found in dto directories - Adapts user data between different formats

### Behavioral Patterns

#### Mediator
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/service/MusicBaseMediator.ts` - Coordinates communication between components
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/service/MusicStreamMediator.ts` - Handles stream-related communications
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/service/MusicUserMediator.ts` - Manages user-related communications

#### Command/CQRS
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/service/music_base/command/CreateMusicCommand.ts` - Command implementation
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/service/music_base/query/GetAllMusicQuery.ts` - Query implementation
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/config/container/MusicBaseService.HandlerRegister.ts` - Command registration

#### Strategy
- **Playlist Service:** `src/services/playlist-service/src/service/generate/strategy/user_group/` - User playlist strategies
- **Playlist Service:** `src/services/playlist-service/src/service/generate/strategy/follow_group/` - Follow-based playlist strategies
- **Playlist Service:** `src/services/playlist-service/src/service/generate/strategy/history_group/` - History-based playlist strategies

#### Observer
- **Payment Service:** Evident in the service workflow handling payment notifications and updates

### Architectural Patterns

#### Microservices
- **Entire Project:** `src/services/` - Contains all independently deployable microservices
- **API Gateway:** `src/services/api-gateway/` - Entry point that routes to appropriate services

#### Repository
- **All Services:** Located in `repository` directories in each service, e.g., `src/services/music-service/src/repository/`
- Abstracts data access from business logic

#### Dependency Injection
- **Music Service:** `src/services/music-service/src/config/container/` - Container configuration
- Uses tsyringe for dependency management throughout services
